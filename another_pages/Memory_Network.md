## Memory Network

Memory Networks are a class of models designed to enhance machine learning systems with a long-term memory component. They can store and retrieve information over extended periods, making them invaluable for tasks requiring context awareness, sequence understanding, and complex problem-solving in areas such as Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning.
